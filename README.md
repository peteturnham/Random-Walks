# Random-Walks
Exploring Random Walk Variables and Methods.
This project is based on Jason Brownlee's explanation of 'Random-Walks' 
*(there are many ways of making a RW program using similar methods but I have found that this one works best with interchanging libraries and modules)*

#Purpose
This project will highlight the Random Walk, Compare Stationary Time Compositions, and attempt at creating AND checking our data to see if it exhibits characteristics of seasonality or randomness with the 'adfueller' method in Python.
